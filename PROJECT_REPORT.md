# Blockchain-Based Professional Profile System
## Project Report

---

# Chapter 1: INTRODUCTION

## 1.1 Project Overview

The **Blockchain-Based Professional Profile System** is a decentralized application (DApp) that creates tamper-proof, verifiable professional credentials using blockchain technology. The system addresses critical challenges in credential verification—fraud, falsification, and time-consuming background checks—by providing an immutable, transparent, and instantly verifiable solution.

Operating on a **Proof of Authority (PoA)** private blockchain, the system enables trusted institutions (universities, employers, certification bodies) to act as validators. Professional credentials are permanently stored on blockchain, making them instantly verifiable and completely tamper-proof.

### Key Features
- Immutable professional records from kindergarten through career
- Multi-type credentials (education, certifications, experience, achievements)
- Role-based access control with institutional verification
- IPFS integration for decentralized document storage
- Mobile-responsive web interface with MetaMask integration

## 1.2 Objectives

**Primary Goals:**
1. Create a secure, tamper-proof credential storage and verification system
2. Track complete professional journeys from early education to career progression
3. Implement role-based access ensuring only authorized institutions add/verify credentials
4. Integrate IPFS for decentralized document storage
5. Provide instant credential verification, reducing hiring time and costs
6. Eliminate resume fraud through immutable blockchain records

## 1.3 Scope and Limitations

**Scope:** Six smart contracts (UserRegistry, ProfileManager, EducationContract, CertificationContract, ExperienceContract, AchievementContract), React-based frontend with six user roles (Admin, Student, Institution, Certifier, Employer, Organizer), complete verification workflow, and IPFS document management.

**Limitations:** Private blockchain only (no public mainnet), requires MetaMask and validator participation, web-based only (no native mobile app), limited to PDF documents, no multi-language support, and no regulatory compliance frameworks.

# Chapter 4: IMPLEMENTATION AND RESULTS

## 4.1 Smart Contract Results

**UserRegistry:** Successfully registers users with validation, prevents duplicates, enforces admin-only functions. Gas cost: ~150,000 per registration.

**EducationContract:** Stores education records on blockchain with proper institution role validation, complete verification workflow, IPFS document hash storage. Gas costs: 250,000 (add record), 80,000 (request verification), 70,000 (approve).

**CertificationContract:** Issues certifications with expiration validation, enforces certifier registration, manages pending verifications. Gas cost: ~200,000.

**ExperienceContract:** Records work experience with employment type categorization, tracks current employment (endDate=0), links IPFS experience letters. Gas cost: ~220,000.

**AchievementContract:** Stores achievements with metadata, skills/technologies arrays, proper organizer registration, category filtering. Gas cost: ~230,000.

## 4.2 Frontend Results

**Wallet Integration:** MetaMask detection and connection, real-time account updates, network validation, connection persistence, graceful error handling.

**Authentication:** User registration validation, unauthorized access prevention, role-based route protection, "Access Denied" modal for unregistered users.

**Admin Panel:** Complete user registration form with 6 role types, search/filter functionality, role color-coded badges, real-time transaction status.

**Credential Modules:** Each module features 3-tab interface with comprehensive forms, student selection dropdowns, IPFS PDF uploads (2-5 seconds), verification request workflows, pending verification displays with approve/reject buttons, and document viewing via IPFS gateway.

## 4.3 Performance & Security

**Performance:** Contract initialization <500ms, transaction submission 2-3 seconds (Ganache), data retrieval <100ms, initial load <2 seconds, block time 2-3 seconds.

**Challenge 2:** Student dropdown not showing names—changed from `getAllUsers()` to `getAllStudents()`.

**Challenge 3:** IPFS keys not loading—created `.env.local` file with priority in Vite.

**Challenge 4:** Frontend not connecting to Ganache—implemented hard refresh and cache clearing.
