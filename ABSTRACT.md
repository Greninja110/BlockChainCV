# Abstract

This report presents a comprehensive overview of the Blockchain-Based Professional Profile System, a decentralized application (DApp) developed to create tamper-proof, verifiable professional credentials using blockchain technology. The primary objective of this project was to create a secure, transparent, and immutable platform that addresses critical challenges in credential verification—including resume fraud, falsification, and time-consuming background check processes. The system is designed to serve as a permanent record repository for tracking an individual's complete professional journey from kindergarten education through career progression, enabling instant verification by employers and institutions while eliminating credential fraud through cryptographic security.

The system architecture is built on a private Proof of Authority (PoA) blockchain network, comprising six interconnected smart contracts totaling 2,515+ lines of Solidity code. The smart contracts were developed using Solidity v0.8.20 with the Hardhat development framework, incorporating OpenZeppelin security patterns including AccessControl, ReentrancyGuard, and Pausable for robust access control and security. The contracts implement a sophisticated role-based permission system with six distinct user roles (Admin, Student, Institution, Certifier, Employer, Organizer), each with specific capabilities for adding, verifying, and managing credentials. Decentralized document storage is achieved through IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) integration via the Pinata API, storing supporting documents (certificates, marksheets, experience letters) off-chain while maintaining cryptographic hashes on-chain. The blockchain network was deployed and tested using Ganache for local development, with comprehensive test coverage (90%+) ensuring contract security and functionality.

On the frontend, a dynamic and intuitive user interface was built using React.js with the Vite build tool, totaling over 5,000 lines of modern JavaScript/JSX code. The application features a component-based architecture with role-specific dashboards, implementing the Context API for state management through WalletContext and ContractContext providers. Web3 integration is powered by ethers.js v6 for seamless blockchain interaction, while MetaMask browser extension handles wallet connection, transaction signing, and account management. The platform features comprehensive credential management modules for education, certifications, work experience, and achievements—each with three-tab interfaces (History, Add Record, Verification Requests) enabling institutions to issue credentials and approve verification requests. Data visualization and user interaction are enhanced through Tailwind CSS for responsive design, while the complete verification workflow (request/approve/reject) provides real-time transaction status updates and IPFS gateway access for document viewing, creating a seamless user experience that abstracts blockchain complexity behind an intuitive interface.
